Notes for seispy package planning:
The current wiggle() function mixed too many functionalities. The two main task wiggle tries to accomplish is following:

(1) have a fast program that plot large number of long traces real time
(2) matlab style plot for small section of data plot in publication

Thus, I decided to split wiggle() into two dedicated functions:

(1) traces() will be used to plot large dataset in real time using pyqtgraph
(2) wiggle() will serves as the matlab wiggle to generate paper-ready plots.
